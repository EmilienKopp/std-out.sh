 * Bridges a WorkOS identity to a local account for the AuthKit callback.
 *
 * - find() is the "findUsing" hook: locate the account, reconciling by verified
 *   email when the WorkOS id changed (e.g. the WorkOS app/environment was
 *   switched) so we adopt the new id instead of colliding on the unique email.
 * - create() is the "createUsing" hook: only reached for genuinely new emails,
 *   and gated by the registration policy.
 *
 * Reconciliation lives in find() on purpose: createUsing fires a Registered
 * event (which provisions a personal team), so re-linking there would create a
 * duplicate team.
